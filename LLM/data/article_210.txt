Galaxy S22/S22+ vs Galaxy S24/S24+: Faster, brighter, now with AI                   Phone By Mihai Matei  Last updated: January 22nd, 2024 at 05:08 UTC+01:00      Samsung"s new Galaxy S24 series is official. Unsurprisingly, the lineup consists of three variants, i.e., the base S24, the Plus, and the Ultra, and they"re all available for pre-order. As usual, Samsung also offers incredible trade-in values in many markets, which might tempt you into upgrading from an older model to the latest one.
So, how do the Galaxy S24 and Galaxy S24+ stack up against the Galaxy S22 and Galaxy S22+? The latter models were released almost two years ago, in February 2022, and although not a lot appears to have changed in terms of exterior design, the Galaxy S24 and S24+ bring some significant upgrades both in hardware and software.
As far as the displays go, the Galaxy S24 and S24+ are now a whole lot brighter at peak levels. The 2024 flagships feature newer Dynamic AMOLED 2X technology with an LTPO / HOP backplane, and they can top 2600 nits of brightness. Furthermore, for the first time, the non-Ultra models get 1-120Hz adaptive refresh rate.
You can now pre-order the Galaxy S24 or Galaxy S24+ before the official January 31 release and benefit from bonuses.
