Kansas City to see sleet, freezing rain into Monday morning - KMBC Kansas City
LOOKS LIKE THEY HAD A REALLY GOOD TIME. SO THAT’S GREAT. AND TALKING ABOUT OUR WEATHER, THINGS ARE NOT SO GREAT. AT LEAST THIS MORNING IF YOU HAD TO TRAVEL OUT AND ABOUT, YOU PROBABLY KNOW IT WAS DANGEROUS AT TIMES THIS AFTERNOON AND THIS EVENING, WE’RE STILL GOING TO FIND A TON OF SLICK SPOTS OUT THERE. BUT THE WORST OF THE FREEZING RAIN IS DONE. RAIN IS GOING TO MOVE BACK IN THIS EVENING, MAINLY AFTER ABOUT 5:00, AND ONCE THE SUN SETS A VERY BRIEF PERIOD OF FREEZING RAIN LOOKS POSSIBLE IN THE KANSAS CITY METRO. YOU MAY BLINK AND MISS IT SO IT’S NOT GOING TO BE AS IMPACTFUL AS WHAT WE SAW EARLIER ON. HOWEVER, THAT CAN’T BE SAID FOR AREAS ALONG AND NORTH OF 36 HIGHWAY WHERE OVERNIGHT TONIGHT MORE WINTRY WEATHER IS POSSIBLE. WE’RE TALKING ABOUT FREEZING RAIN, SLEET, EVEN SOME SNOW WITH MINOR ACCUMULATIONS. NOT OUT OF THE QUESTION. TURNING TO OUR CLOUDS AND RADAR. EASY TO POINT OUT WHERE THAT ROUND OF FREEZING RAIN THAT MOVED THROUGH THE KC METRO THIS MORNING IS. NOW IT EXTENDS FROM A LINE NEAR SPRINGFIELD UP TO SAINT LOUIS AND MOVING INTO ILLINOIS. SO AWAY FROM US, THE CLOUD DECK IS VERY THICK OVERHEAD THOUGH, SO BENEATH THAT TEMPERATURES ARE HOVERING NEAR FREEZING. THERE STILL COULD BE SOME POCKETS OF FREEZING DRIZZLE THIS AFTERNOON. AND THEN HERE COMES OUR NEXT BATCH OF RAIN. MAYBE SOME FREEZING RAIN THIS EVENING THAT IS DEVELOPING NOW OUT NEAR CENTRAL OKLAHOMA. THERE’S A LIVE LOOK FROM OUR CITY VIEW CAMERA OVER THE PLAZA. BOY DOES THIS PICTURE SCREAM WINTER. WE HAVE LOW VISIBILITY SNOW. STILL SOME SLICK SPOTS OUT THERE. 33 DEGREES WINDS ARE OUT OF THE SOUTH AT 11MPH. THAT PUTS OUR WIND CHILL. THE FEELS LIKE TEMPERATURE DOWN TO 24, SO YOU’LL WANT THE WINTER COAT AS YOU STEP OUT THIS AFTERNOON. IT’S 32, IN ODESSA. SAME WITH MARSHALL, SO THESE NEAR FREEZING TEMPERATURES STICK AROUND THIS AFTERNOON. A LITTLE WARMER IN LIBERTY AT 3433 DEGREES IN CAMERON. AND NOW FOR THE NEXT COUPLE OF HOURS, WE’LL SEE ON AND OFF DRIZZLE. MAINLY CLOUDY SKIES, BUT WEATHER IMPACTS BEGIN AGAIN THIS EVENING BY 6:00 AS MORE RAIN STARTS TO MOVE IN. LET’S SHOW YOU WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE ON FUTURE SCAN. WE’LL PUT THIS INTO MOTION. WE’RE GOING TO PAUSE THIS FOR YOU RIGHT AT ABOUT EIGHT. YOU CAN SEE WHERE SOME OF THAT PINK IS MOVING THROUGH THE KANSAS CITY METRO. THAT IS THAT VERY BRIEF ROUND OF FREEZING RAIN. IT SHOULDN’T AMOUNT TO MUCH, BUT ONCE YOU GET ACROSS NORTHERN MISSOURI OVERNIGHT TONIGHT, THAT WINTRY WEATHER WILL CONTINUE. SO WE’RE TALKING ABOUT MARYVILLE TO TRENTON, WHILE THE REST OF US SIT UNDERNEATH POCKETS OF LIGHT TO MODERATE RAIN SHOWERS. SOME OF THAT WILL CONTINUE INTO OUR TUESDAY MORNING BEFORE THINGS WRAP UP BRIEFLY. TUESDAY AFTERNOON. ANOTHER ROUND OF RAIN TUESDAY NIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY. SOME SHOWERS POSSIBLE ON THURSDAY. WE’RE CLOUDY AND OVERCAST WITH THAT WEATHER PATTERN OF GLOOMY CONDITIONS STICKING AROUND.
Monday is a First Alert Impact Day after sleet and freezing rain that moved through the area overnight left a mess behind on our roadways. While the worst of the freezing rain has moved out of the area, slick spots remain for the evening commute. Roads, sidewalks, driveways, parking lots, and more, will be impacted by a thin glaze of ice.Problems were reported on area roadways, and dozens of school districts made the decision to either shift to an AMI day, or to call a snow day Monday morning. Chad Crilley says while the worst of the freezing rain is gone, a patch or two may mix-in with rain expected overnight.  Another round of light rain and wintry mix is possible Monday night and could result in more problems Tuesday morning.Stay with the First Alert Weather Team for updates.
