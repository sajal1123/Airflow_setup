      "Barcelona may have found an answer to a whole host of social, health, and environmental ills.The city began implementing \"superblocks\" — \"superillas\" in Catalan — a decade ago as a way to cut air pollution. The project essentially limited through-traffic in a cluster group of nine square city blocks, creating greener and more pedestrian-friendly streets.\n",
      "Early opposition to the pilot project soon gave way to widespread support as residents experienced the benefits of quieter, cleaner streets and intersections that functioned more as parks than thoroughfares. Since then, the model has been replicated in neighborhoods across the city.The green spaces — which range from temporary seating areas to permanent playgrounds and other installations — have transformed streets for cars into plazas and linear parks. The idea is to cut noise and air pollution, get people to walk, bike, and exercise more, enhance social cohesion within neighborhoods, and build climate resiliency with cooler, greener streets, city officials say.\n",
      "Superblocks feature people napping on benches, walking their dogs, or hanging at a cafe in in the middle of an intersection-turned-plaza. Kids run and bike freely — including in organized school bike squads. With a speed limit of 10 kilometers per hour (just over 6 mph), vehicles inside the green oases no longer threaten the peace and safety of residents.Earlier this year, the city announced yet another major expansion of the project, with a goal of making a third of city streets green by 2030.The Spanish city is far ahead of many of its peers when it comes to building walkable green spaces, but its efforts could be a model for cities around the world. Dense, walkable, mixed-use neighborhoods are increasingly in high demand in the US. And as Americans experience an epidemic of loneliness, a built environment that fosters social connection might be crucial for public health.\"It really goes beyond just a traffic-calming measure,\" said Sven Eggimann, an urban infrastructure researcher at the ZHAW School of Architecture in Switzerland. \"This concept really tries to tackle noise, health, social space, urban greenery. I mean, you name it.\"\n",
      "People who live in communities with more walkable neighborhoods, shared space, greenery, and diverse types of housing, feel more socially connected and less lonely. This is in part because public spaces encourage both incidental interactions between strangers and acquaintances — so-called \"weak\" social ties — and spontaneous interactions between friends, both of which boost a sense of belonging and connection.And research has found that noise pollution is tied to mental health conditions like sleeplessness and depression, while air pollution is associated with dementia and strokes.Superblocks create accessible and, crucially, free \"third places\" — gathering spaces outside of home, work, and school — that are key to fighting loneliness.Superblocks are \"destinations,\" said Tayana Panova, a researcher who studies the built environment's effects on mental health. \"You don't have to be moving through them. You can stop there, and rest, and connect and play, and just enjoy life.\"\n",
      "Without squares, plazas, and public green space, people are limited to third places that cost money to be in, likes shops, restaurants, bars and cafes, Panova added.\"The third place offers opportunities for for people to meet and come across people that they really wouldn't have the opportunity to, to interface with if it were not for these desirable public spaces,\" Jonathan Cohn, a transportation and infrastructure architect who's worked on public space initiatives in New York City.Residents of Barcelona's superblocks are already seeing positive mental health impacts. Efforts to make much of the city greener and more walkable are expected to reduce both visits to mental health specialists and the use of antidepressants by 13%, according to a survey.Spreading the superblock gospelBarcelona didn't invent superblocks — it got the idea from the nearby city of Vitoria-Gasteiz, which saw a huge drop in air and noise pollution when it implemented the concept in 2008. Urban planners around the world have developed all kinds of ways to slow and reduce traffic.\n",
      "Many cities across Europe have either banned or strictly limited vehicle traffic in their downtowns. Superblocks are similar to the Dutch \"woonerf,\" which translates to living street, and is characterized by car-light, curb-less roads that prioritize pedestrians and bicyclists.Something like a superblock is most urgent in areas that suffer from high levels of noise and air pollution and lack street greenery. And they need to be densely populated — this isn't a practical option for neighborhoods dominated by single-family homes — and have some amount of public transit, Eggimann said.Excited to see the superilla/superblock idea developing in cities outside of Barcelona. Valencia has a beautiful new version. They refer to it as a supermanzana & it’s looking good pic.twitter.com/pyi2lKhNzc— Billy Fields (@BillyISTEP) July 13, 2023 No American city has attempted any pedestrianization effort on the scale of what Barcelona is doing. But some dense urban areas are working on smaller-scale projects. New York City has built pedestrian plazas along sections of Broadway in Manhattan and is experimenting with temporary, car-free \"Open Streets.\" San Francisco has implemented \"slow streets,\" which discourage through-traffic on largely residential blocks.Rather than embarking on a grand vision of dramatic change, cities can try \"doing small things fast,\" Eggimann said, so that residents can see the benefits quickly.\n",
      "There are also downsides that have to be planned for. Making a neighborhood more attractive with more walkable, green streets could mean triggering or speeding up gentrification. Making it harder to drive when public transportation isn't simultaneously improved could make commutes harder.It's clear that while there might be political challenges and initial opposition, Americans want greener communities with more public space. More walkable communities with high-quality public spaces are much more expensive to live in, indicating high demand. Home buyers in the biggest cities in the US pay 35% more to live in walkable neighborhoods and renters pay 41% more, according to a report published earlier this year by Smart Growth America.Getting people to drive less or give up their parking spots is a serious challenge. And it requires messaging tailored to the specific community. In Switzerland, where urban planners are attempting to calm traffic in major cities, Superblocks would need to be rebranded to something more appealing, Eggimann said.\"The name doesn't work because no one wants to be super and live in blocks,\" he said.\n"

But they are likely part of a broader workplace culture that prioritizes innovation, trusts its workers and has other employee-friendly benefits, says Debbie Lovich, a senior partner at Boston Consulting Group, whose firm worked on the analysis.\\nIsraeli forces raided the Al-Shifa Hospital complex in Gaza—the enclave’s largest medical facility—early Wednesday, in what they described as a “precise and targeted operation” against Hamas, which it has accused of operating a command post inside tunnel complexes underneath Al-Shifa. The raid comes a day after UN officials raised alarm about the deteriorating conditions at the hospital, where thousands of civilians, patients and doctors are believed to be sheltering.\\nThe House of Representatives passed a stopgap measure to avert a government shutdown that keeps the government funded through January, setting the stage for another round of appropriations bills early next year. The resolution does not include foreign aid to Israel or Ukraine, but the House passed a $14.3 billion aid package for Israel earlier this month.\\nThe core inflation index, which is more steady and excludes the typically variable food and energy indexes, moderated in October to its lowest level in two years. Consumer prices were flat month-over-month for the first time since July 2022, but there’s still plenty of work to do to bring inflation down to the Federal Reserve’s goal of 2%.\\nMORE: Stocks rallied following the report’s release, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 climbing to their highest levels since September 15, while the Nasdaq hit its top price since August 1. The gains officially wiped out nearly all of early fall’s market losses, as investors continue to bet that the worst effects of monetary policy tightening are in the rearview mirror.\\nA bull market for bonds that lasted four decades came to an abrupt halt in 2020, and Forbes asked two longtime watchers of the yield curve for their thoughts on what’s next. Gary Shilling is bullish, and has long made the very contrarian argument that inflation was destined to recede, while James Grant is the bear, sour on both government bonds and the dollars with which they will be redeemed.\\nDonor-advised funds have become popular charitable-giving vehicles for the ultra-wealthy, as they come with generous tax benefits, have few disclosure or payout requirements and require less oversight on the donor’s part. In 2022, contributions to DAFs throughout the U.S. hit a new high of $86 billion, an $8 billion increase from the prior year, according to a new report released Tuesday by National Philanthropic Trust.\\nIsrael has asked TikTok and Meta to remove over 8,000 posts related to the Hamas conflict that they allege violate the companies’ policies and incite violence and terrorism, according to the Israeli state prosecutor’s office. The agency said it had requested the removal of content that incited violence and terrorism, as well as any promotion of groups widely designated as terrorists, and that 94% of the content it flagged across major social sites has been taken down.\\nA deal announced Tuesday will allow Snapchat users to purchase Amazon products on the app, and it sent Snap Inc’s stock up more than 7% after the company has faced years of ad revenue struggles. Still, Snap is far from its heyday, when the stock peaked at a price of around $83 in September 2021, 692% higher than Tuesday’s price.\\nTruth Social, former President Donald Trump’s social media site, has lost $73 million since its launch last year, according to a regulatory filing, raising concern about the platform’s financial condition and its ability to continue operations. The filing notes that the company’s success is heavily tied to Trump’s “reputation and popularity” and it “may diminish.”\\nSPORTS + ENTERTAINMENTSAG-AFTRA President Fran Drescher (L) speaks as SAG-AFTRA National Executive Director Duncan Crabtree-Ireland looks on at a press conference discussing their strike-ending deal with the Hollywood studios on November 10, 2023 in Los Angeles, California. (Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images)Getty Images\\nHollywood actors ended their nearly four-month long strike last week after finally reaching a deal with major studios securing protections for actors against AI, but some SAG-AFTRA members who feel the terms of the deal don’t go far enough are urging colleagues to vote no. A summary of the deal released by the union Monday outlined protections including mandatory consent from performers, or from representatives of deceased performers, to create a “digital replica” of an actor, but some critics say the proposed contract has loopholes.\\nBankrupt FTX Wants To Sell $100 Million Of Crypto Per Week, Will The SEC Stop It?Current FTX CEO John Ray and SEC Chair Gary Gensler could find themselves on FTX’s plan to sell crypto to repay creditors.ILLUSTRATION BY CECILIA ZHANG FOR FORBES; PHOTOS BY NATHAN HOWARD/STRINGER/GETTY IMAGES; WIN MCNAMEE/GETTY IMAGES\\nTOPLINE A year has passed since FTX failed, long enough for U.S. prosecutors to get a conviction of Sam Bankman-Fried, its disgraced founder. While that may offer some cold comfort to about a million creditors with funds tied up in the company’s bankruptcy, what would be better is to get some of their money back.\\nThere is one potential roadblock: the SEC is not fond of cryptocurrency trading as it is currently practiced in the U.S. It is suing Binance and Coinbase, claiming they are acting as financial exchanges when they are not licensed to do so and that digital assets they list are unregistered securities.\\nWhether the SEC should be in charge of cryptocurrency is an open question. Congress has been unable to decide how to deal with an asset class that has existed for only 15 years, and although there are multiple lawsuits working their ways through the court system that might decide the matter, none will be resolved in time to provide clarity for the FTX case.\\nWHY IT MATTERS “If the SEC lets these sales go through without objection, they could hurt its arguments in court and in front of Congress that it should be the industry’s top cop,” says Steven Ehrlich, director of research for Forbes Digital Assets. “This case is just another example of the collateral damage being caused by the regulatory mess in the U.S. that is forcing paralysis in the crypto industry as it seeks a rulebook.”\""

       "\"It is generally assumed or expected that a country’s stock market performance should be positively correlated with its GDP growth. Thus, if a country is doing well on the growth front, its stock market should do well. Similarly, growth slowdown should lead to corrections in stock market indices, for instance the Sensex or the Nifty 50.Most equity analysts opine that the single most important driver of stock market performance is actual or expected changes in corporate earnings, and economic expansion (in contrast to economic contraction) that positively affects earnings and in turn, share prices. It would be interesting to analyse if this hypothesis applies to India.Story continues below AdvertisementRemove AdLooking at time series data about the performances of the US GDP and S&P 500 shows that there is a positive correlation between the two, except during the pandemic and other major crises such as the Great Depression or the Dotcom (2000) burst. The S&P 500 gave decent returns during the pandemic even though the US economy tanked, primarily because of the massive fiscal and monetary stimulus. Something similar happened in many other markets including the EU and India.But in the case of China, despite robust GDP growth on a consistent basis between 1999 and 2019, there have been wild swings in the performance of its stock markets. For instance, the Shanghai Composite (SHCOMP) Index witnessed massive gains in some years and poor returns in others. Moreover, the returns on SHCOMP during the Covid years had been unimpressive vis-a-vis India, EU and the US.The Indian Evidence Related stories Moneycontrol Pro Panorama | Investors’ carpe diem momentMeat Sale Ban: MP needs a more nuanced policy to ensure food hygiene and safetyESIC adds 17.28 lakh subscribers in October As shown in the above chart, the correlation between the performance of the Indian economy as measured by its GDP growth and the Sensex is not strong, and this has been more so in the last couple of years.One would want to argue that stock markets are forward-looking and driven by expectations about how the economy will perform. If investors believe that a country's GDP will grow in the future, they may buy stocks in anticipation of higher corporate profits even though the current GDP numbers are not good. This is especially so after the Indian government slashed corporate income tax in September 2019, which has led to an increase in the share of corporate profits in the country’s GDP.Story continues below AdvertisementRemove AdNevertheless, corporate earnings don’t provide the full picture, at least in India’s case. Global developments, for instance the US Fed’s actions and unexpected swings in crude oil prices strongly influence Indian stock market prices even though there is no real change in the domestic economic output or its outlook. Amidst sticky inflation and the rupee (almost always under pressure), interest rate hikes by the US Fed affect Indian stock markets in two ways - through increasing interest rate differentials between India and the US (thereby improving the relative attractiveness of US bonds), and by putting pressure on the RBI to go hawkish, that tends to penalise interest rate sensitive sectors such as automotive, banks, infrastructure and real estate, metals as well as companies with high debt-to-equity ratios (irrespective of sectors) which have substantial weights in the Sensex and Nifty 50.The inflows from foreign institutional investors (FIIs) have been playing a major role in influencing stock prices in India. However, their actions are guided by factors which are mostly outside the control of Indian policy makers, for instance, US Fed actions (as mentioned above), and actual or expected performance of other economies in the region such as China. The moves of FIIs can also be influenced by changes in relative valuations of stock market indices of different countries competing for foreign capital. Thus, the FIIs may start selling in overvalued markets like India and that will drive down stock prices even if there is no change in the country’s economic growth outlook. Movements in exchange rates also tend to influence such decisions.However, of late, steadily increasing participation from retail investors either directly or through mutual funds has reduced the influence of FII flows. The absolutely and relatively low penetration of financial products, equity and equity-based mutual funds, in particular, means that there would be faster deployment of retail money especially when the stock markets are on the upswing.Similarly, stringent limits on Indians buying shares of companies listed abroad through the LRS (Liberalised Remittance Scheme), the $ 7 billion cap and unfavourable taxation force Indians to allocate a higher proportion of their capital in Indian stock markets. That provides an additional support to the country’s equity market.Too Many VariablesGiven India’s excessive dependence on import of crude oil and substantial weights of oil and gas companies in benchmark indices, any unexpected surge in global energy prices may lead to sell off of shares of energy companies by both domestic as well as foreign investors leading to correction in their share prices and in turn in Sensex and Nifty 50.Even otherwise, different sectors within an economy may respond differently to GDP growth. Some sectors, such as consumer discretionary, may be more sensitive to economic expansion, while defensive sectors such as consumer staples or pharmaceuticals may be less influenced by short-term fluctuations in GDP growth.On a longer term basis, political stability encourages business activities and strengthens investor confidence. That is good for stock markets. On the other hand, regulatory flip-flops and knee-jerk reactions to major macroeconomic challenges such as sticky inflation or worsening trade deficits dampen the profitability prospects of companies in the affected sectors and in turn their stock market performances, often independently of GDP growth. Thus, stringent export curbs on rice, steel and sugar, aimed at reining in inflation have ended up adversely affecting the top and bottom lines of companies operating in these sectors leading to corrections in their share prices. Similarly, import curbs aimed at reducing trade deficit and supporting the rupee have led to increased costs for companies engaged in retailing and dampened their stock market prospects.At present, the geopolitical sweet-spot and the China plus one strategy is favouring all kinds of manufacturing companies in India and in turn aiding their stock prices that have no immediate connection to the country’s economic growth.Last but not the least, human psychology plays a major role in stock markets by affecting investor sentiments. Thus, excessive fear - caused by economic factors such as runaway inflation or sharp increases in tax rates, and non-economic factors such as a deadly pandemic or wars may lead to sell-off irrespective of how an economy\\xa0 is doing and thus override the fundamental relationship between GDP growth and stock prices.To sum up, it's essential to recognise that while there is a historical tendency for stock markets to perform well in growing economies with reasonable macroeconomic stability, the correlation is not perfect, especially for a country like India as many other variables including difficulty to predict human psychology, tend to influence investor behaviour, and in turn returns on stock market investments.Then there could be variations in sectoral performances. For instance, the performance of India’s banking and financial sector as measured by the Nifty Bank index doesn’t really reflect the robust earnings reported by banking and financial companies vis-a-vis infrastructure companies for instance,\\xa0 in the last couple of quarters. Moreover, despite sharp contractions in India’s GDP growth rates during Covid, its stock markets have delivered one of their best returns in decades.Ritesh Kumar Singh is a business economist and CEO, Indonomics Consulting Private Limited, a policy research and advisory startup.
